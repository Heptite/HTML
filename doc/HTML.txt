==============================================================================
1. Introduction						*html-intro*

To start, you should familiarize yourself with Vim enough to know the
terminology, and you should know HTML to some degree.

The mappings are local to the buffer the script was sourced from (normally
this happens automatically when editing an HTML type buffer), and the menu and
toolbar are active only for buffers the script was sourced from.

This help file follows the Vim help file standards. To see what modes a
mapping works in see the tags above and to the right. The notation is X_TT,
where "X" means the mode, and "TT" means the mapping. For example, the |;;|
mapping below works in normal mode (|n_;;|), insert mode (|i_;;|), and visual
mode (|v_;;|).  This plugin does not define any mappings for :-command mode.

I have tried to keep the tags in mostly alphabetical order, but related tags
are grouped in various ways, which interferes with that ordering.

							*html-smart-tag*
The noted tags are "smart", meaning Vim will detect whether to close then open
a tag instead of open then close the tag.  For example, if the cursor is
inside italicized text and you type ;it, it will insert </I><I> instead of
<I></I>.  Only tags that should never nest are candidates for being "smart".

							*n_;;* *i_;;* *v_;;*
;;	Most of the mappings start with ; so ;; is mapped to insert a single
	; character in insert mode, behave like a single ; in normal mode,
	etc. (The semicolons in this mapping are changed to whatever
	|g:htmlplugin.map_leader| is set to.)

							*i_;&*
;&	The HTML |character-entities| insert mode mappings start with &, so
	typing ;& in insert mode will insert a literal & character.
	(In actuality this mapping is defined as |g:htmlplugin.map_leader| +
	|g:htmlplugin.entity_map_leader| to insert whatever is in
	|g:htmlplugin.entity_map_leader|.) (Note that this mapping behaves
	very differently in visual mode. See: |v_;&|)

				*html-<Tab>* *html-tab* *html-CTRL-I*
				*i_html-<Tab>* *i_html-tab* *i_html-CTRL-I*
				*v_html-<Tab>* *v_html-tab* *v_html-CTRL-I*
<Tab>	If the cursor is on a closing tag the <Tab> key jumps the cursor after
	the tag. Otherwise the <Tab> key will jump the cursor to an unfilled
	tag somewhere in the file. For example, if you had the tag:
>
	 <A HREF=""></A>
<
	And you hit <Tab>, your cursor would be placed on the second " so you
	could insert text easily. After filling in some text, the next time
	you hit <Tab> it would be placed on the < character of </A>. And the
	third time you hit <Tab> the cursor would be placed on the > of </A>,
	and so on. This works for tags split across lines, such as:
>
	 <TABLE>
	 </TABLE>
<
	See |g:htmlplugin.no_tab_mapping| if you do not want these mappings to
	be defined, in which case ;<Tab> will be used for the mappings
	instead.

	[I think the use of tab is acceptable because I do not like the idea
	of hard tabs or indentation greater than one or two spaces in HTML.]

			*html-<S-Tab>* *html-shift-tab* *html-SHIFT-CTRL-I*
			*i_html-<S-Tab>* *i_html-shift-tab* *i_html-SHIFT-CTRL-I*
			*v_html-<S-Tab>* *v_html-shift-tab* *v_html-SHIFT-CTRL-I*
	This is much like the above <Tab> mapping but goes in reverse.

				*i_;<Tab>* *i_;tab* *i_;CTRL-I*
				*n_;<Tab>* *n_;tab* *n_;CTRL-I*
				*i_;<S-Tab>* *i_;shift-tab* *i_;SHIFT-CTRL-I*
				*n_;<S-Tab>* *n_;shift-tab* *n_;SHIFT-CTRL-I*
;<Tab>	To insert a hard tab (; then the tab key). If
	|g:htmlplugin.no_tab_mapping| is set this mapping replaces the normal
	|html-tab| mapping instead.  (See |g:htmlplugin.map_leader|) And
	likewise, ;<S-Tab> (shift-tab) can be used.

							*html-template*
								*n_;html*
;html	This macro inserts a basic template at the top of the file. If the
	buffer already contains some text you are asked if you want to replace
	it or add the template anyway. (See |g:htmlplugin.map_leader|)

	See |g:htmlplugin.template| for information on how to customize the
	template.


==============================================================================
2. Author's notes:					*html-author-notes*

This plugin makes a number of assumptions under the umbrella of assuming the
user's Vim binary was compiled with a standard level of features, sometimes
called the "Normal" version. However, this has not been fully tested by the
author because he operates with the "Huge" version that includes nearly all
compile-time features available to Vim.

The Content-Type charset automatic detection value based on the 'fileencoding'
/ 'encoding' option has a very incomplete translation table from the possible
values that Vim uses. I could use help with this.

I need someone to help me update the BrowserLauncher code for MacOS, namely to
test to make sure it still works, and add support for Google Chrome.

I will never include mappings for certain tags, such as <BLINK></BLINK> and
<MARQUEE></MARQUEE> (which were always nonstandard). As far as I am concerned
these tags should never have existed.


==============================================================================
3. Customization Variables		*html-variables* *html-configuration*
					*html-customization* *g:htmlplugin*

You can set the g:htmlplugin global |Dictionary| variable to control the
behavior of the plugin. It is recommended you set this variable in your
|vimrc|, as some of the keys are only effective if they are set before the
plugin loads.

Note that you need to do ":let g:htmlplugin = {}" first or you will get an
error, or you can just set everything at once in your |vimrc|, e.g.: >
	let g:htmlplugin = {
		\	'author_name': 'John Smith',
		\	'author_email': 'jsmith@example.com',
		\	'do_xhtml_mappings': v:false,
		\	'tag_case': 'uppercase'
		\}
<
Also note that in the following text, "nonzero" means anything besides "no",
"false", "off", 0, or "" (empty value), case insensitive.

*g:htmlplugin.do_xhtml_mappings* *b:htmlplugin.do_xhtml_mappings*
Set this variable to a nonzero value if you prefer XHTML compatible tags to be
defined. Setting this forces |b:htmlplugin.tag_case| to "lowercase". This is
automatic if you are already editing a file that Vim detects as XHTML. This
variable must be set before HTML.vim is sourced for the current buffer. You
can also set this on a per-buffer basis by using
b:htmlplugin.do_xhtml_mappings instead.  e.g.: >
	:let g:htmlplugin.do_xhtml_mappings = 'yes'
(However, XHTML is out of date and this mode is not recommended, and is only
supported for historical reasons.)

*g:htmlplugin.tag_case* *b:htmlplugin.tag_case*
This variable can be set to "l" / "lower" / "lowercase" or "u" / "upper" /
"uppercase" to determine the case of the text in the HTML tags. This variable
must be set before HTML.vim is sourced for the current buffer (i.e. before the
buffer is loaded). The default is "lowercase". You can also set this
globally by setting |g:htmlplugin.tag_case| or on a per-buffer basis by using
|b:htmlplugin.tag_case| instead. This variable is ignored when editing XHTML
files (see |g:htmlplugin.do_xhtml_mappings|). e.g: >
	:let g:htmlplugin.tag_case = 'lowercase'

*g:htmlplugin.tag_case_autodetect*
Set this variable to a nonzero value if you want to automatically detect what
the value of |b:htmlplugin.tag_case| should be. This is done by examining the
file for both upper and lower case tags (tag attributes are not examined). If
only one type is found the tag case for the buffer is set to that value. This
variable is ignored if you have set |g:htmlplugin.do_xhtml_mappings| or
|b:htmlplugin.do_xhtml_mappings|. e.g.: >
	:let g:htmlplugin.tag_case_autodetect = 'yes'

*g:htmlplugin.map_leader*
This variable can be set to the character you want for the leader of the
mappings defined under |html-tags|, the default being ";". This variable must
be set before HTML.vim is sourced. You can set this to your |mapleader| or
|maplocalleader|. e.g.: >
	:let g:htmlplugin.map_leader = g:maplocalleader

*g:htmlplugin.entity_map_leader*
This variable can be set to the character you want for the leader of the
character entity insert mode mappings defined under |character-entities|, the
default being "&". This variable must be set before HTML.vim is sourced. If
you attempt to set this to the same value as |g:htmlplugin.map_leader| you
will get an error. e.g.: >
	:let g:htmlplugin.entity_map_leader = '\'

*g:htmlplugin.no_map_override*
Set this variable to a nonzero value if you do not want this plugin to
override mappings that already exist. When this variable is not set you will
get a warning message when this plugin overrides a mapping. This variable
must be set before HTML.vim is sourced. e.g.: >
	:let g:htmlplugin.no_map_override = 'yes'

This only applies to the mappings defined internally to the plugin. If you
call the |HTMLFunctionsObject.Map()| function elsewhere you will still get a warning
message when there is an already existing mapping and the mapping will still
be overridden.

*g:htmlplugin.no_maps* *b:htmlplugin.no_maps*
Set this variable to a |List| to match against mappings. If a mapping to be
defined matches one of the items in the list it will not be defined.  You can
also set this on a per-buffer basis by using b:htmlplugin.no_maps instead.
The list items are case sensitive, will not undergo |g:htmlplugin.map_leader|
and |g:htmlplugin.entity_map_leader| substitution, and must be set before
HTML.vim is sourced. e.g., to suppress the <A HREF>, <IMG SRC> and the
centered headings tags: >
	:let g:htmlplugin.no_maps = [';ah', ';im', ';H1', ';H2', ';H3',
		\ ';H4', ';H5', ';H6']

This only applies to the mappings defined internally to the plugin. If you
call the |HTMLFunctionsObject.Map()| function elsewhere the mapping will be defined
even if it matches this list; this is useful if you wish to define custom
variants of some of the plugin's mappings without getting warning messages.

*g:htmlplugin.no_tab_mapping*
Set this variable to a nonzero value if you do not want the tab key to be
mapped in normal, visual and insert mode. ;<Tab> will be used instead. See
|html-tab| and |i_;tab|. This variable must be set before HTML.vim is sourced
for the current buffer. e.g.: >
	:let g:htmlplugin.no_tab_mapping = 'yes'

Note that you can suppress the defining of both <Tab> and ;<Tab> as a mapping
by adding "\t" to |g:htmlplugin.no_maps| instead.

*g:htmlplugin.no_toolbar*
Set this variable to a nonzero value if you do not want this plugin to modify
the Vim toolbar and add "T" to 'guioptions'. This variable must be set before
HTML.vim is sourced. e.g.: >
	:let g:htmlplugin.no_toolbar = 'yes'

*g:htmlplugin.no_menu*
Set this variable to a nonzero value if you do not want the menu items to be
defined at all. This implies that |g:htmlplugin.no_toolbar| is set as well.
This variable must be set before HTML.vim is sourced. e.g.: >
	:let g:htmlplugin.no_menu = 'yes'

*g:htmlplugin.toplevel_menu*
Set this to the toplevel menu where you want the HTML menu to become a
submenu. The value must be a |List|, must be set before the first time the
script is sourced, and there is no way to override the "HTML" menu name.
e.g.: >
	:let g:htmlplugin.toplevel_menu = ['Plugin']

*g:htmlplugin.toplevel_menu_priority*
Set this to the priority (position) you want for the toplevel HTML menu.  If
you placed the HTML menu in a submenu, it affects the HTML's menu within that
submenu position.  The value must be a positive |Number|, and must be set
before the first time the script is sourced, e.g., make the menu appear before
all others: >
	:let g:htmlplugin.toplevel_menu_priority = 1

*g:htmlplugin.template* *b:htmlplugin.template*
Set this variable to the location of your template file to be used by the
|n_;html| mapping. You can also set this on a per-buffer basis by using
|b:htmlplugin.template| instead. If unset, a basic internal template will be
used.

See |html-template-tokens| for special tokens you can use within the template.

*g:htmlplugin.author_name* *b:htmlplugin.author_name*
*g:htmlplugin.author_email* *b:htmlplugin.author_email*
Within the internal template, |b:htmlplugin.author_name| is inserted inside >
	<META NAME="Author" CONTENT="...">
<|b:htmlplugin.author_email| is converted to |b:htmlplugin.authoremail_encoded|
and inserted inside >
	<LINK REL="made" HREF="mailto:...">
<	e.g.: >
	:let g:htmlplugin.author_name  = 'John Smith'
	:let g:htmlplugin.author_email = 'jsmith@example.com'

These two variables are also used for the <ADDRESS></ADDRESS> section of the
internal template.

The default for these variables are empty strings.

*g:htmlplugin.author_email_encoded* *b:htmlplugin.author_email_encoded*
This variable will be set using |HTMLFunctionsObject.TranscodeString()| if your
|g:htmlplugin.author_email| variable is set. (Do not set this variable
yourself, it will be overwritten when the template macro is used.)

*g:htmlplugin.author_url* *b:htmlplugin.author_url*
The author's homepage. Replaces the |authorurl| token in the template.

*g:htmlplugin.bgcolor* *g:htmlplugin.textcolor* *g:htmlplugin.linkcolor*
*g:htmlplugin.alinkcolor* *g:htmlplugin.vlinkcolor*
*b:htmlplugin.bgcolor* *b:htmlplugin.textcolor* *b:htmlplugin.linkcolor*
*b:htmlplugin.alinkcolor* *b:htmlplugin.vlinkcolor*
These control the CSS in the internal template and can also be used as
|html-tokens| in the user defined template. They default to: >
	:let g:htmlplugin.bgcolor     = '#FFFFFF'
	:let g:htmlplugin.textcolor   = '#000000'
	:let g:htmlplugin.linkcolor   = '#0000EE'
	:let g:htmlplugin.alinkcolor  = '#FF0000'
	:let g:htmlplugin.vlinkcolor  = '#990066'

*g:htmlplugin.default_charset*
This defaults to "UTF-8" and is the value used if a character set can not be
detected by the 'fileencoding' or 'encoding' options. See |i_;ct| and
|html-tokens| for how this is used. (Also see |html-author-notes|)

*g:htmlplugin.charset* *b:htmlplugin.charset*
If either of these variables are set it completely overrides the Content-Type
charset detection for the |i_;ct| mapping and in the |html-tokens|. Normally
these should be left unset.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					*html-template-tokens* *html-tokens*

When you define a template file with the |g:htmlplugin.template| or
|b:htmlplugin.template| variable, special tokens within the template will
automatically replaced with their corresponding variable value:

Token:			Variable: 			Description: ~
*%authorname%*		|b:htmlplugin.author_name|	Author's name
*%authoremail%*		|b:htmlplugin.author_email_encoded|
							Author's email address,
							encoded to prevent spam
*%authorurl%*		|b:htmlplugin.author_url|	Author's homepage
*%bgcolor%*		|b:htmlplugin.bgcolor|		Main background color
*%textcolor%*		|b:htmlplugin.textcolor|	Main text color
*%linkcolor%*		|b:htmlplugin.linkcolor|	Unvisited link color
*%alinkcolor%*		|b:htmlplugin.alinkcolor|	Mouse hover link color
*%vlinkcolor%*		|b:htmlplugin.vlinkcolor|	Visited link color

Special tokens: ~
%date%						*%date%*
This is replaced with the output of strftime("%B %d, %Y")  (e.g.: March 16,
2004). You can send custom fields to the |strftime()| call by embedding !...
(rather than %...) notation before the second "%" in the token. e.g.: >
	%date!m/!d/!Y !l:!M !p !Z%
Would produce something like: >
	03/08/2007  5:59 PM MST
Note that spaces before and after the format string are ignored, and you can
get literal "%" and "!" characters inside the custom format by preceding them
with backslashes. e.g.: >
	(%date  \%!r\!  %)
Would produce something like: >
	(%05:59:34 PM!)
See http://strftime.net/ for a list of tokens that may work on your system,
but remember to use "!" characters in place of "%" characters.

%time% or %time12%				*%time%* *%time12%*
This is replaced with the output of strftime("%r %Z") (e.g.: 05:59:34 PM MST)

%time24%					*%time24%*
This is replaced with the output of strftime("%T %Z") (e.g.: 17:59:34 MST)

%charset%					*%charset%*
This is replaced by a string that is automatically detected based on the
'fileencoding' or 'encoding' option. This can be overridden, see
|g:htmlplugin.default_charset| and |g:htmlplugin.charset|. (Also see
|html-author-notes|)

%vimversion%					*%vimversion%*
The current version of Vim, based on |v:version| and |v:versionlong|. For
example, if v:version was "901" and v:versionlong was "9010220" the
%vimversion% token would be replaced by "9.1.220".

%include {file}%					*%include%*
This will include {file} into the current template at the location it appears.
{File} is searched for relative to the template and the directory of the
current buffer.


For example, if you had the template: >
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <HTML LANG="en">
  <HEAD>
   <META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=%charset%">
   <META NAME="Author" CONTENT="%authorname%">
   <META NAME="Copyright" CONTENT="Copyright (C) %date% %authorname%">
   <LINK REL="made" HREF="mailto:%authoremail%">
   <STYLE TYPE="text/css">
    <!--
    BODY {background: %bgcolor%; color: %textcolor%;}
    A:link {color: %linkcolor%;}
    A:visited {color: %vlinkcolor%;}
    A:hover, A:active, A:focus {color: %alinkcolor%;}
    -->
   </STYLE>
  </HEAD>
  <BODY>
   <P>
   </P>
  </BODY>
 </HTML>
<
You would get something like: >
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <HTML LANG="en">
  <HEAD>
   <META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
   <META NAME="Author" CONTENT="John Smith">
   <META NAME="Copyright" CONTENT="Copyright (C) August 16, 2021 John Smith">
   <LINK REL="made" HREF="mailto:&#x6A;&#x73;&#x6D;&#x69;&#x74;&#x68;&commat;&#x65;&#x78;&#x61;&#x6D;&#x70;&#x6C;&#x65;&period;&#x63;&#x6F;&#x6D;">
    <STYLE TYPE="text/css">
     <!--
     BODY {background: #FFFFFF; color: #000000;}
     A:link {color: #0000EE;}
     A:visited {color: #990066;}
     A:hover, A:active, A:focus {color: #FF0000;}
     -->
    </STYLE>
  </HEAD>
  <BODY>
   <P>
   </P>
  </BODY>
 </HTML>

==============================================================================
4. Commands						*html-commands*

The following commands are only defined in HTML buffers.

							*:HTMLabout*
:HTMLabout
	Show information about the plugin.

	*disable-HTML-macros*	*disable-HTML-mappings*	*disable-HTML-plugin*
	*enable-HTML-macros*	*enable-HTML-mappings*	*enable-HTML-plugin*
							*:HTMLplugin*
:HTML[plugin] {disable/off/enable/on}
	This command allows the HTML macros to be disabled and re-enabled.
	This is useful for editing inline PHP, JavaScript, etc. where you
	would want to be able to type literal ";", "&" and tab characters
	without interference. (Also see |i_;;|, |i_;&| and |i_;<Tab>|)

	Note that all of the mappings defined by calling |HTMLFunctionsObject.Map()|
	or |HTMLFunctionsObject.Mapo()|--including all of the mappings defined by
	this script--are disabled/enabled when this command is used,
	regardless of what |g:htmlplugin.map_leader| is set to.

							*:ColorChooser* *:CC*
:ColorChooser
:CC
	Open a popup with the standard HTML color palette displayed and
	highlighted with their respective color. (Note that the highlighting
	only works in the |GUI| or a |'termguicolors'| capable terminal.)

	Keyboard movement commands such as "j" and "k" apply in this popup.
	Pressing enter selects the hexadecimal color number, shift-enter
	selects the color name, "r" selects the rgb() value, and "R" selects
	the rgb() percent value. You can abort by pressing escape or "q".  You
	can also either double-click on the name to select it, or the color
	number to select that. Finally you can hold down shift while you
	double click to insert the rgb() value, or hold down control and
	double click to insert the rgb() percent value.

	This command fails if you are not in an HTML buffer.

	(See: |;cc|)


==============================================================================
5. Mappings for Normal <> Tags				*html-tags*

Most of these mappings are insert or visual mappings. In insert mode the tag
is inserted and the cursor placed where you would likely want to insert text.
In visual mode, the tag is wrapped around the visually selected text in a
hopefully logical manner. (See |i_;ah|, |v_;aH| and |i_;ab| for explicit
examples--the rest of the mappings that work in visual mode are similar.)

						*html-operator-mappings*
						*html-motion-mappings* *n_;*
The noted (with |n_;|) normal mode ;-mappings take a {motion} operator. These
mappings function as if you had visually highlighted the text covered by the
motion and invoked the corresponding visual mapping.

If you are editing an XHTML file (see |g:htmlplugin.do_xhtml_mappings|) the
tags will be compatible with XHTML. (However, XHTML is out of date and this
mode is not recommended, and is only supported for historical reasons.)

Note that you can change the leader character for these mappings from ';' to
another character of your preference. See |g:htmlplugin.map_leader|.


							*html-doctype*
							*n_;4* *i_;4*
;4	Inserts >
	<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
	 "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
<	at the top of the file. If the current buffer is XHTML, it will be >
	<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
	 "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<	(See |g:htmlplugin.do_xhtml_mappings|)
							*n_;s4* *i_;s4*
;s4	Does the same as |n_;4|, but the document type is strict rather than
	transitional. (Note that these macros are meant for a transitional
	document type and transitional tag mappings will always be defined, so
	be careful.)
							*n_;5* *i_;5*
;5	Inserts >
	<!DOCTYPE html>
<	at the top of the file, for HTML 5. (Note there is no transitional or
	strict version of this.)
							*n_;cc* *i_;cc* *v_;cc*
;cc	A shortcut mapping to call |:ColorChooser|.
							*html-content-type*
							*i_;ct*
;ct	Inserts >
	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
<	at the current cursor position.

	The actual value of the charset is automatically detected based on the
	'fileencoding' or 'encoding' option. This can be overridden--see
	|g:htmlplugin.default_charset| and |g:htmlplugin.charset|. (If this
	doesn't insert the correct charset value, see |html-author-notes|.)
							*html-comment*
							*i_;cm* *v_;cm* *n_;cm*
;cm	Comment tag: >
	<!-- -->
<	(|html-smart-tag|) (|n_;|)
							*html-a-href*
							*i_;ah* *v_;ah* *n_;ah*
;ah	Anchor hyper link: >
	<A HREF=""></A>
<	Visual mode puts the visually selected text <A HREF="">here</A> and
	positions the cursor on the second ". (|html-smart-tag|) (|n_;|)
							*i_;aH* *v_;aH* *n_;aH*
;aH	Same as |i_;ah|, but puts the visually selected text <A HREF="here">
	and places the cursor on the < of </A>. If this is used in insert mode
	rather than visual mode, the contents of the |clipboard| are placed
	between the quotes. (|n_;|)
							*i_;at* *v_;at* *n_;at*
;at	Like |i_;ah| but include TARGET="" in the tag. (|n_;|)
							*i_;aT* *v_;aT* *n_;aT*
;aT	Like |i_;aH| but include TARGET="" in the tag. (|n_;|)
							*html-article*
							*i_;ar* *v_;ar* *n_;ar*
;ar	Self-contained article: >
	<ARTICLE>
	</ARTICLE>
<	(|n_;|)
							*html-aside*
							*i_;as* *v_;as* *n_;as*
;as	Content aside from surrounding context: >
	<ASIDE>
	</ASIDE>
<	(|n_;|)
							*html-abbreviation*
							*i_;ab* *v_;ab* *n_;ab*
;ab	Abbreviation: >
	<ABBR TITLE=""></ABBR>
<	Visual mode puts the visually selected text <ABBR TITLE="">here</ABBR>
	and positions the cursor on the second ". (|n_;|)
							*i_;aB* *v_;aB* *n_;aB*
;aB	Same as |i_;ab|, but puts the visually selected text <ABBR
	TITLE="here"> and places the cursor on the < of </ABBREV>. If this is
	used in insert mode rather than visual mode, the contents of the
	|clipboard| are placed between the quotes. (|n_;|)
							*html-address*
							*i_;ad* *v_;ad* *n_;ad*
;ad	Address: >
	<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<	(|n_;|)

6. Mappings for &...; Codes		*character-codes* *character-entities*

A number of mappings have been defined to allow insertion of special
characters into the HTML buffer. These are known as characters entities.

							*n_;&* *v_;&*
;&	This mapping converts the motion or visually selected characters to
	their &...; (name) or &#x...; (hexadecimal) entities if a name for
	that character doesn't exist, where "..." is equivalent to the ASCII
	hexadecimal representation. For example, "Fish & Chips" would become:
	"&#x46;&#x69;&#x73;&#x68;&#x20;&amp;&#x20;&#x43;&#x68;&#x69;&#x70;&#x73;".
	(See |i_;&|) (|n_;|)

	This can be very slow if you translate a long string and syntax
	highlighting is enabled.

	Notes:
	- Spaces are translated to the &nbsp; entity which stands for
	  nonbreaking space, which is slightly different from a space; this
	  is considered a useful compromise.
	- The "&" in this mapping is not translated to whatever
	  |g:htmlplugin.entity_map_leader| is set to, while the ";" is
	  translated to whatever |g:htmlplugin.entity_map_leader| is set to.
							*n_;star* *v_;star*
;*	Similar to |n_;&| / |v_;&| but encodes to purely hexadecimal codes
	instead.
							*n_;%* *v_;%*
;%	This mapping converts the motion or visually selected characters to
	their %XX hexadecimal string for URIs. For example, "Fish & Chips"
	would become:
	"%46%69%73%68%20%26%20%43%68%69%70%73".
	(|n_;|)

	(Note that this will not touch Unicode characters. See
	|HTMLFunctionsObject.TranscodeString()|)
							*n_;^* *v_;^*
;^	This mapping will decode the &..., &#...; and %XX elements of the
	motion or visually selected characters to their actual characters.
	(|n_;|)


The following mappings work in insert mode only.

Note that you can change the leader character for these mappings from '&' to
another character of your preference. See |g:htmlplugin.entity_map_leader|.

7. How to Use Browser Mappings				*browser-control*

You can use a browser to preview your current HTML document.

Note that support for more browsers will probably not be added as many
browsers use the same rendering engines as either Firefox or Google Chrome.


For Mac OS X:					*browser-control-macos*

Opening new tabs and windows depends on the built-in Graphic User Interface
Scripting architecture of Mac OS X which comes disabled by default. You can
activate GUI Scripting by selecting the checkbox "Enable access for assistive
devices" in the Universal Access preference pane.

For Unix:					*browser-control-unix*

The following mappings are only defined if you have installed the
corresponding browsers. |n_;db| is only defined if xdg-open is installed.

For Windows (and Cygwin):			*browser-control-windows*

The following mappings, aside from |n_;db| are only defined if you have
installed the corresponding browsers in a standard location (i.e. on your C:\
drive).

							*html-default-browser*
								*n_;db*
;db	Call the default browser on the current file. For Unix this requires
	"xdg-open" to be installed.
							*html-edge-browser*
								*n_;ed*
;ed	Make Microsoft Edge view the current file, starting Edge if it is not
	running. You will get an error dialog if Edge is not installed. (Only

8. Miscellaneous Extras					*html-misc*


Some of the functions used by the HTML mappings:	*html-functions*
------------------------------------------------

These functions are now wrapped into a class called HTMLFunctions, and must be
imported and a new object created to be used, herafter referred to as
HTMLFunctionsObject.

To create the object, first include the file in your |vim9script|: >
	
	import autoload 'HTML/functions.vim'

<Then create the object: >

	var HTMLFunctionsObject = functions.HTMLFunctions.new()
<

					*HTMLFunctionsObject.TranscodeString()*
HTMLFunctionsObject.TranscodeString({string} [, {...}])
	Returns {string} encoded into HTML entities, or decode HTML encoded
	strings.

	The second argument controls how the string is handled:

	Argument:	Behavior: ~
	d/decode	Decode the %XX, &...;, &#...;, and &#x...; elements of
			the provided string
	%		Encode as a %XX URI string
	x		Encode as a &#x...; string (hexadecimal)
	omitted		Encode as a &...; or &#x...; string (name, or
			hexadecimal)
	other		No change to the string

	See |n_;&|, |n_;star|, and |n_;%| for examples.

	Notes:
	- Unicode characters can not be safely converted to %XX hex strings
	  for URIs due to a limit in the specification, so this function will
	  leave them untouched. This limitation does not apply to encoding to
	  or from &...; entities.
	- Null characters will be converted to newlines, due to a limitation
	  in Vim itself.

					*HTMLFunctionsObject.GenerateTable()*
HTMLFunctionsObject.GenerateTable([{rows}, {columns}, {border-width}, {thead}, {tfoot}])
	This is normally called by the |n_;tA|, mapping but it can be called
	with argumetns to non-interactively generate a table:

	Argument:	Behavior: ~
	{rows}		|Number|: Number of rows to insert
	{columns}	|Number|: Number of columns to insert
	{border-width}	|Number|: Width of the border in pixels (not HTML5
			compatible; leave at 0 and use CSS)
	{thead}		|Boolean|: Whether to insert a table header
	{tfoot}		|Boolean|: Whether to insert a table footer

	If a table header or table footer is inserted, a table body tag will
	also be inserted.  Note that the header and footer is exclusive of the
	row count.

	This function returns true if a table was generated, false otherwise.

						*HTMLFunctionsObject.Map()*
HTMLFunctionsObject.Map({maptype}, {lhs}, {rhs} [, {options}])
	This function defines a mapping, local to the buffer and silent.
	{maptype} is any map command. {lhs} and {rhs} are equivalent to `:map`
	arguments, see |map.txt|. This is useful for autocommands and HTML
	filetype plugins.

	If {lhs} starts with "<lead>" that string will replaced with the
	contents of |g:htmlplugin.map_leader|.

	If {lhs} starts with "<elead>" that string will replaced with the
	contents of |g:htmlplugin.entity_map_leader|.

	Any text in {rhs} that is enclosed by [{}] will be converted to
	uppercase/lowercase according to the |g:htmlplugin.tag_case| or
	|b:htmlplugin.tag_case| variable, and the [{}] markers will be
	removed.

	{options} is optional, but if it exists it's a |Dictionary| that
	specifies changed mapping behavior; for insert mode and visual mode
	mappings:

	{"expr": true} ~
	Run the {rhs} of the mapping as an expression and "type" the result.

	{"extra": false} ~
	Do not add extra magic to the visual mapping. This suppresses the
	other options.

	For visual mappings only:

	{"insert": true} ~
	The visual mapping enters insert mode. 

	{"reindent": N} ~
	Re-indent the visually selected lines, plus N lines below. This value
	is usually going to be 1, and sometimes 2; very rarely other values.

	This function returns true if a map was defined, false otherwise.

HTMLFunctionsObject.Mapo({map} [, {insert}])	*HTMLFunctionsObject.Mapo()*
	Creates an operator-pending mapping wrapper for {map} that calls the
	visual mapping by the same name. {insert} is a |Boolean| value that
	indicates whether to end in insert mode, default false.

	This function returns true if a map was defined, false otherwise.

					*HTMLFunctionsObject.NextInsertPoint()*
HTMLFunctionsObject.NextInsertPoint([{mode}, {direction}])
	This is normally called by the |i_;<Tab>| mapping, but it works the
	same if called any other way. The {mode} argument is either 'i' or 'n'
	(default) which means |Insert| or |Normal|. In insert mode, if the
	cursor is on the start of a closing tag it places the cursor after the
	tag.  The {direction} argument is either 'f' or 'b', which means
	search forward or backward, respectively. The defaults for the two
	options are 'n' and 'f'.

	This function returns true if the cursor was moved, false otherwise.

					*HTMLFunctionsObject.PluginControl()*
HTMLFunctionsObject.PluginControl({what})
	This is normally called by the |:HTMLplugin| command.  It can either
	disable or enable the mappings by specifying "on" or "true" as {what},
	or "off" or "false" to disable.

HTMLFunctionsObject.Template()			*HTMLFunctionsObject.Template()*
	This is normally called by the |n_;html| mapping, but it works
	the same if called any other way.

	This function returns true if the cursor is on an insert point, false
	otherwise.

						*HTMLFunctionsObject.SetIfUnset()*
HTMLFunctionsObject.SetIfUnset({variable}, {value})
	This function sets {variable} to {value} if the variable is not
	already set. A {value} of "" makes sure the variable is set with an
	empty string, a {value} of [] initializes to an empty list, and a
	value of {} initializes to an empty dictionary. Be sure to enclose
	the variable name in quotes. This function will not work for
	function-local variables (|l:var|).

	This function returns 1 if the variable was set, 0 if it already
	existed, and -1 for an error.
