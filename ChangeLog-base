 Switching to RCS logging

January 15, 2001
 Wrote an HTML.txt documentation file in Vim helpfile format.  For Vim6, put
 it somewhere in the 'runtimepath' and use the :helptags command.  (Read the
 help.)  While doing this, I somehow stumbled onto the fact that 'cpoptions'
 might not have a 'sane' value for this script to run, so it's saved and
 reset, then restored at the end of the script.

 Deleted the commented mappings that are now superseded by HTMLmap() calls.
 There are still some commented in the 'old format', but they were commented
 originally.

 I'm not sure this script works with Vim versions earlier than 5.7 now, and
 I have no way to test it.  You really should be using 5.7 (or whatever the
 latest stable release is) anyway, so upgrade if you have problems.

December 30, 2000
 Interactive table generation function, with normal mode ;ta mapping.
 Toolbar button switched to use this, and menu items tweaked.

 The <TAB> mapping now handles <TAG>^M</TAG> patterns if the user is using
 Vim 6.  Removed some unnecessary pattern code from the search() call.

December 12, 2000
 Missed some mappings.  Removed all hard tabs.  Tweaks.

December 10, 2000
 Created HTMLmap function that makes the mappings local to the buffer if the
 Vim verison is 6 or above.  The function is left defined so it can be used
 in autocommands.

 The syntax for the search() function in Vim 6 changed.

October 07, 2000
 Added form mappings and submenu.

September 08, 2000
 Added more character entities, reordered the HTML menu slightly.

March 30, 2000
 Command that calls the SetIfUnset function.

February 26, 2000
 Added more stuff to the ;html template.  Now if you have html_authorname
 and html_authoremail set, they're inserted in the template when it's used.

October 06, 1999
 <BODY> tag now sets "all" the colors, and they're configurable via
 variables:
   html_bgcolor     Page background color.
   html_textcolor   Page text color.
   html_linkcolor   Link color.
   html_alinkcolor  Link color when mouse is clicking on it.
   html_vlinkcolor  Visited link color.

 SetIfUnset function.  Sets a variable to a value if it's not already set to
 some value.

August 18, 1999
 Added normal-mode menu items for character entities.

 Added a few more visual mappings, plus the corresponding menu items.

August 17, 1999
 Redid all the visual mappings.  They didn't work linewise.  Added a few
 more.

 Refined the menus and several of the mappings.

 Don't load the browser remote control stuff if it's already loaded.

August 16, 1999
 Added menu items for the character entity mappings.  (Insert mode only.)

 The addition of menu separators, which only works for 5.4 and up.  (Still
 usable with 5.3, but the separators are normal menu entries, which is ugly
 and potentially hazardous.  Don't select them.)

August 14, 1999
 Added a bunch of visual mappings.  Visually select an area, type one of
 the macros and the selected area is surrounded by that HTML tag.  (Not all
 tags will do this.)  This allows me to add some corresponding vmenu items.

 Added menu items for most of the mappings.

June 24, 1999
 Tweaked the <TAB> mappings.  Now it removes the search from the history and
 sets the search back to the previously used search.  This eliminates the
 need for a :nohlsearch in the mapping and hitting 'n' will do what's
 expected.  (The mapping isn't set if the version is less than 5.4.)

June 11, 1999
 Tweaked the template function.

April 18, 1999
 Ported the perl browser control code to direct vimscript.  This is only
 possible with Vim 5.4 greater.  The mappings and code aren't defined if the
 version is less than 5.4, so it's still usable with 5.3.

 Removed the old template creation macros.  They were just in the way.

March 28, 1999
 Added many &...; codes a while ago.  Added the <TAB> mapping.  Tweaked the
 ;html macro.  Now requires Vim 5.4 or greater.  (Still works with 5.3, but
 it spits out an error and doesn't go into insert mode on the ;html macro.)

February 05, 1999
 Now uses user defined functions, so it requires Vim 5.3(?) or greater.

April 17, 1998
 Changed for Vim 5, this version will no longer run under standard VI.
 (In fact, it won't run on anything earlier than Vim 5.)
