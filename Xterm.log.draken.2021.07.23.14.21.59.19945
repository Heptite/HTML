[m
       Not all of the features described in this manual are necessarily[m
       available in this version of [4mxterm[24m.  Some (e.g., the non-VT220[m
       extensions) are available only if they were compiled in, though the[m
       most commonly-used are in the default configuration.[m
[m
[1mOTHER FEATURES[0m[m
       [4mXterm[24m automatically highlights the text cursor when the pointer enters[m
       the window (selected) and unhighlights it when the pointer leaves the[m
       window (unselected).  If the window is the focus window, then the text[m
       cursor is highlighted no matter where the pointer is.[m
[m
       In VT[4mxxx[24m mode, there are escape sequences to activate and deactivate an[m
       alternate screen buffer, which is the same size as the display area of[m
       the window.  When activated, the current screen is saved and replaced[m
       with the alternate screen.  Saving of lines scrolled off the top of the[m
       window is disabled until the normal screen is restored.  The usual[m
       terminal description for [4mxterm[24m allows the visual editor [4mvi[24m(1) to switch[m
       to the alternate screen for editing and to restore the screen on exit.[m

[m
               Some versions of [4mxterm[24m may have logging enabled.  However,[m
               normally logging is not supported, due to security concerns in[m
               the early 1990s.  That was a problem in X11R4 [1mxterm [22m(1989)[m
               which was addressed by a patch to X11R5 late in 1993.  X11R6[m
               included these fixes.  The older version (when running with[m
               [4mroot[24m privilege) would create the log file using [4mroot[24m privilege.[m
               The reason why [4mxterm[24m ran with [4mroot[24m privileges was to open[m
               pseudo-terminals.  Those privileges are now needed only on very[m
